# This is an introduction example for the Flatland 2.1.* version.
# Changes and highlights of this version include
# - Stochastic events (malfunctions)
# - Different travel speeds for differet agents
# - Levels are generated using a novel generator to reflect more realistic railway networks
# - Agents start outside of the environment and enter at their own time
# - Agents leave the environment after they have reached their goal
# Use the new sparse_rail_generator to generate feasible network configurations with corresponding tasks
# Training on simple small tasks is the best way to get familiar with the environment
# We start by importing the necessary rail and schedule generators
# The rail generator will generate the railway infrastructure
# The schedule generator will assign tasks to all the agent within the railway network
