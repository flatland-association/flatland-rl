Flatland is a open-source toolkit for developing and comparing Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithms in little (or ridiculously large!) gridworlds.

[The official documentation](http://flatland.aicrowd.com/) contains full details about the environment and problem statement

Flatland is tested with Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 on modern versions of macOS, Linux and Windows. You may encounter problems with graphical rendering if you use WSL. Your [contribution is welcome](https://flatland.aicrowd.com/misc/contributing.html) if you can help with this!
