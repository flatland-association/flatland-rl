## [Unreleased]


## [4.0.2] - 2024-04-23

### Performance improvement

The rail generators (infrastructure) implementation is based on A*. The A* implementation has been improved in terms of calculation time. The main modification concerns the internal data structure which was widely used in the A* algorithm. The used ordered set is replaced by a heap that allows to fetch the nearest nodes in O(1) instead of O(n).
