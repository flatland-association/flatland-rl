## [4.0.3] - 2024-04-23

### Github Action Release failed

Fixed.

## [4.0.2] - 2024-04-23

### Performance improvement

The rail generators (infrastructure) implementation is based on A*. The A* implementation has been improved in terms of calculation time. The main modification
concerns the internal data structure which was widely used in the A* algorithm. The used ordered set is replaced by a heap that allows to fetch the nearest
nodes in O(1) instead of O(n).

## [4.0.1] - 2023-10-30

### Fixed

- Removed dependency on an old version of `gym` which in turn brought in an old version of `pyglet` that caused issues
  on Windows.

## [4.0.0] - 2023-10-27

### Removed

- Dropped support for Python 3.7 because it's end of life.

### Changed

- Improved performance by introducing an LRU cache.

- Updated a lot dependencies.
- Cleaned the project structure.
- First release handled by the [flatland association](https://www.flatland-association.org/)!

### Fixed
