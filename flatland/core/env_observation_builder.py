"""
ObservationBuilder objects are objects that can be passed to environments designed for customizability.
The ObservationBuilder-derived custom classes implement 2 functions, reset() and get() or get(handle).

+ `reset()` is called after each environment reset, to allow for pre-computing relevant data.

+ `get()` is called whenever an observation has to be computed, potentially for each agent independently in case of \
multi-agent environments.
