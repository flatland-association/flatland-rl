    Grid4Transitions class derived from Transitions.

    Special case of `Transitions` over a 2D-grid (FlatLand).
    Transitions are possible to neighboring cells on the grid if allowed.
    GridTransitions keeps track of valid transitions supplied as `transitions`
    list, each represented as a bitmap of 16 bits.

    Whether a transition is allowed or not depends on which direction an agent
    inside the cell is facing (0=North, 1=East, 2=South, 3=West) and which
    direction the agent wants to move to
    (North, East, South, West, relative to the cell).
    Each transition (orientation, direction)
    can be allowed (1) or forbidden (0).

    For example, in case of no diagonal transitions on the grid, the 16 bits
    of the transition bitmaps are organized in 4 blocks of 4 bits each, the
    direction that the agent is facing.
    E.g., the most-significant 4-bits represent the possible movements (NESW)
    if the agent is facing North, etc...

    agent's direction:          North    East   South   West
    agent's allowed movements:  [nesw]   [nesw] [nesw]  [nesw]
    example:                     1000     0000   0010    0000

    In the example, the agent can move from North to South and viceversa.
